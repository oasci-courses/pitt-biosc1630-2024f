Topics in computational biology will be explored using primary literature.
Students will present research articles orally and complete a series of writing assignments that will culminate in producing a literature review paper.

## Overview

Computational biology as a field moves extremely fast and is communicated almost exclusively through scientific literature.
Most courses in the computational biology degree teach you computer science or biology outside the context of the field.
This course&mdash;at least my version of it&mdash;provides time and space to upskill their computational biology knowledge by routinely reading primary research.

The instructor will assign a scientific article across various computational biology subfields for students to read each week.
Early in the semester, our focus will be learning and gaining experience digesting and understanding the article.
As the semester progresses, we will practice critiquing our articles, ensuring you are prepared and confident in your understanding of the material.

## Web analytics

Why would we want to track website traffic?

An instructor can gain insights into how students engage with online teaching materials by analyzing web analytics.
This information is instrumental in assessing the effectiveness of the materials.
Web analytics reveal the popularity of specific topics or sections among students and empower instructors to tailor future lectures or discussions.
Analytics also provides valuable data for curriculum development, helping instructors identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses in course materials.
Additionally, instructors may leverage web analytics as evidence of their commitment to continuous improvement in teaching methods, which is helpful in discussions related to professional development, promotions, or tenure.
