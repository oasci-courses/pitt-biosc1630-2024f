## Catalog description

Topics in computational biology will be explored using primary literature.
Students will present research articles orally, as well as complete a series of writing assignments that will culminate in the production of a literature review paper.

## Prerequisites

You must be a Junior or Senior on the CBUAS-BS and CBUSCI-BS plan.
You must also have completed BIOSC 1540 with a minimum grade of C **and** one of the following courses:

-   ENGFLM 0210;
-   FP (0003 or 0006).

## Writing intensive

BIOSC 1630 will fulfill the requirement for a writing-intensive course in the Computational Biology major.
The [Dietrich School of Arts & Sciences Writing Institute defines this as](https://www.writinginstitute.pitt.edu/w-courses/proposing-new-writing-intensive-courses)

-   a course in which students engage with writing substantively throughout the term;
-   they write and revise throughout the term (not just at the end);
-   they write a total of 5750&mdash;6250 words;
