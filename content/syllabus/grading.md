!!! danger "DRAFT"

    This page is a work in progress and is subject to change at any moment.

Letter grades for this course will be assigned based on the [Pitt's recommended scale](#scale).
As the semester progresses, you will be able to clearly see your standing in the course.

## Distribution

The course will have the following point distribution.

## Late assignments and extensions

TODO: I need to rework this methodology.

I am mindful of the diverse nature of deadlines, particularly in the scientific realm.
Some are set in stone, while others exhibit more flexibility.
It is noteworthy that the scientific community frequently submits manuscripts and reviews days, weeks, or months after the editor's request.
Such practices are widely understood.
Conversely, submitting a grant application even a minute past the deadline makes it ineligible for review.

I will use the following late assignment and extension policy.
It encourages timely submissions while acknowledging the influence of external commitments and unforeseen circumstances.

-   Each student will start with **2% extra credit**.
-   Every assignment comes with **an automatic two-day extension window**.
    No explanation or justification is needed.
-   However, **using this extension will result in a deduction of your extra credit worth 10% of the assignment**.
    For example, if you submit an assignment worth 50 points one day late, your extra credit will be reduced by 5 points.
-   After this extension window, the assignment will not be accepted (i.e., zero points), but no extra credit will be lost.
-   Exceptions for the loss of extra credit will be made on a case-by-case basis.
-   Once your extra credit becomes zero, no late assignments will be **automatically** accepted.
    Each assignment will lose 0.2% for every hour it is late&mdash;with minutes always rounded up.
    For example, if an assignment is due on Thursday at 11:59 pm, and you turn it in on Saturday at 11:03 am, it would be 36 hours late and 7.2% would be taken off from your assignment.

If you submit every assignment on time, the extra credit is worth 2% of your total grade&mdash;equal to a bump to the next highest letter grade if you are close.
Thus, I will not round up any final grades.

## Scale

The following scale will be used to assign letters for midterm and final grades.

Letter grade | Percentage | GPA |
------------ | ---------- | --- |
A+ | 97.0 - 100.0% | 4.00 |

B+ | 87.0 - 89.9% | 3.25 |
B | 83.0 - 86.9% | 3.00 |
B- | 80.0 - 82.9% | 2.75 |
C+ | 77.0 - 79.9% | 2.25 |
C | 73.0 - 76.9% | 2.20 |
C- | 70.0 - 72.9% | 1.75 |
