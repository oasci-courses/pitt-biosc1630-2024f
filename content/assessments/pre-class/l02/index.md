This assignment will be graded mainly for completion. Don't worry if you're unsure about some aspects&mdash;the goal is to prepare you for our discussion.

## Paper Summary

Read the introduction and conclusion of the paper "Chemprop: A Machine Learning Package for Chemical Property Prediction." Write a brief summary (1 paragraph) that includes:

-   What problem Chemprop is trying to solve
-   One potential application in chemistry mentioned in the paper

## Interesting Features

Look through the paper and list three features or capabilities of Chemprop that you find interesting.
You don't need to fully understand them - just note what catches your attention.

## Questions for Discussion

As you read, you'll likely encounter terms or concepts that are unfamiliar.
List two things you'd like clarified during our class discussion.

## Chemical Properties

Chemprop is designed to predict chemical properties. In 2-3 sentences, describe a chemical property you've learned about in your studies and why predicting it might be useful.

## Diagram Interpretation

Look at Figure 1 in the paper. In your own words, try to describe what this diagram is showing. Don't worry about getting it perfectly right - focus on what you can understand from the image.

## Reflection

In 2-3 sentences, reflect on how you think tools like Chemprop might be useful in chemistry. Consider both potential benefits and any concerns you might have.
