???+ tip
    Do not get too bogged down by the methodology.
    Your instructor will go over the following topics in the respective lecture.

    1. Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations:
        - Basic principle: computer simulation of physical movements of atoms and molecules
        - Applications in computational biology and drug discovery
    2. Force Fields:
        - Definition: set of parameters used to calculate the potential energy of a system of atoms
        - Examples mentioned in the paper: GAFF and OpenFF
    3. Free Energy Calculations:
        - Importance in drug discovery (predicting binding affinities)
        - Brief overview of traditional methods like Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) and Thermodynamic Integration (TI)
    4. Alchemical Transformations:
        - Concept of "morphing" one molecule into another in silico
        - Why it's useful for calculating relative binding free energies
    5. Sampling in MD Simulations:
        - Importance of exploring conformational space
        - Challenges with traditional methods (e.g., getting "stuck" in local energy minima)
    6. Enhanced Sampling Techniques:
        - General concept of improving exploration of conformational space
        - Brief mention of replica exchange as an example

## Q01

What is the main goal or purpose of this study?

## Q02

The authors applied RE-EDS to four different kinase systems.
List these kinases and briefly describe the types of ligand modifications studied for each.

## Q03

What two small molecule force fields were used in this study?
Why do you think the authors chose to use multiple force fields?

## Q04

Briefly explain the concept of "hybrid topology" used in this paper.
How does it differ from "dual topology"?

## Q05

What metric did the authors use to assess the accuracy of their binding free energy calculations?
What value is considered the threshold for "chemical accuracy"?

## Q06

For which kinase system did RE-EDS perform best?
For which did it perform worst?
What factors may have contributed to these differences?

## Q07

What were some of the key limitations or challenges identified for the RE-EDS method?

## Q08

Based on the results, what are the potential applications or benefits of using RE-EDS for drug discovery?

## Q09

What questions do you have about the paper?
