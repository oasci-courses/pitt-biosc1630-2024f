The final draft of your perspective paper in computational biology is **optional**.
If you are satisfied with the grade received on your draft, that same grade will be applied to your final draft.
However, if you would like to improve your grade, you may incorporate feedback from your draft and submit a final version for reassessment.

!!! note

    - Your final draft grade **cannot go down** as long as no drastic detrimental changes are made.
    - If you are happy with your draft grade, you do **not** need to submit a final draft.
