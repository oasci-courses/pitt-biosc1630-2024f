## Additional guidance

Remember, the goal of this section is to provide a solid foundation for understanding your perspective.
Take your time to research thoroughly and present the information clearly and logically.

1.  **Start with an Outline:** Before writing, create a detailed outline of your Field Overview. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure you cover all necessary points.
2.  **Use Topic Sentences:** Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. This helps with organization and makes your writing easier to follow.
3.  **Explain Technical Terms:** When introducing a new concept or technical term, always provide a brief, clear explanation. Don't assume your reader knows all the terminology.
4.  **Use Transitional Phrases:** To improve flow between paragraphs and sections, use transitional phrases like "Furthermore," "In contrast," "Similarly," or "However."
5.  **Avoid Jargon and Acronyms:** While some technical language is necessary, avoid excessive jargon. Always spell out acronyms on first use.
6.  **Be Concise:** Aim for clarity and brevity. Avoid unnecessarily complex sentences or repetition.
7.  **Use Evidence:** Support your statements with evidence from your research. This often involves citing relevant studies or quoting experts in the field.
8.  **Revise and Edit:** After writing your first draft, set it aside for a day, then return to revise. Look for areas to improve clarity, flow, and accuracy.
9.  **Seek Feedback:** Ask a classmate, tutor, or instructor to review your draft. Fresh eyes can often spot areas for improvement that you might miss.
10.  **Use Writing Resources:** Utilize your university's writing center or online resources for additional help with scientific writing.
