## Additional guidance

Remember, the goal of this section is to provide a solid foundation for understanding your perspective.
Take your time to research thoroughly and present the information clearly and logically.

1.  **Start with an Outline:** Before writing, create a detailed outline of your Field Overview. This will help you organize your thoughts and ensure you cover all necessary points.
2.  **Use Topic Sentences:** Begin each paragraph with a clear topic sentence that introduces the main idea. This helps with organization and makes your writing easier to follow.
3.  **Explain Technical Terms:** When introducing a new concept or technical term, always provide a brief, clear explanation. Don't assume your reader knows all the terminology.
4.  **Use Transitional Phrases:** To improve flow between paragraphs and sections, use transitional phrases like "Furthermore," "In contrast," "Similarly," or "However."
5.  **Avoid Jargon and Acronyms:** While some technical language is necessary, avoid excessive jargon. Always spell out acronyms on first use.
6.  **Be Concise:** Aim for clarity and brevity. Avoid unnecessarily complex sentences or repetition.
7.  **Use Evidence:** Support your statements with evidence from your research. This often involves citing relevant studies or quoting experts in the field.
8.  **Revise and Edit:** After writing your first draft, set it aside for a day, then return to revise. Look for areas to improve clarity, flow, and accuracy.

## Tips for Success

-   Critically evaluate your sources, ensuring they are reputable and relevant.
-   Have a peer review your work for clarity and comprehensiveness.
-   Revise and refine your overview to ensure it provides a solid foundation for your perspective.

## Common feedback

1.  Instead of using headings like "Key Concepts" or "Molecular Dynamics", use assertion statements like, "Molecular simulations are invaluable for novel drug targets".
2.  In-text citations should be in the format of: `(Maldonado et al., 2024)`.
3.  Ensure that your writing is academically formal.
4.  When talking about other methods or packages, it is crucial that provide each with an individual citation.
    It is better to add a citation than leave it out.
    For example,

    > There are many MD simulation packages such as AMBER (CITE), NAMD (CITE), and GROMACS (CITE).
5.  Always remember to ask yourself, "What value does this sentence have here?" and "Would the reader be able to understand the perspective without this sentence"?
