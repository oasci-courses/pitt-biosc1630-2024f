This assignment will help you identify relevant scientific articles for your upcoming perspective paper.
The focus is on creating a works cited list and brief summaries to ensure you're on the right track with your research.

!!! tip
    This assignment should take approximately two hours to complete.
    If you find yourself spending significantly more time, you may be reading the papers too in-depth at this stage.
    Focus on efficiently identifying relevant articles and their key points rather than detailed reading.

## Objective

Practice finding appropriate scientific articles and creating brief summaries of their main points.
This process mimics the initial stages of literature review for a graduate-level perspective piece.

## Instructions

1.  Conduct a literature search to identify 7-10 relevant scientific articles related to your chosen perspective primer topic.
    -   Include at least five primary research articles.
    -   These articles will form the basis of your works cited for the perspective paper.
2.  For each article, provide:
    -   Full citation in APA format
    -   A brief 2-3 sentence summary highlighting:
        -   Main research question or objective
        -   Key methodology (for primary articles)
        -   Principal findings or conclusions

    !!! note
        These summaries should be based on quickly scanning the abstract, introduction, and conclusion of each paper.
        Do not read the entire paper at this stage.

## Submission Guidelines

-   Submit your work as a PDF file through [Canvas](https://canvas.pitt.edu/courses/267146).
-   Use 12-point font, 1.5 line spacing, and 1-inch margins.
