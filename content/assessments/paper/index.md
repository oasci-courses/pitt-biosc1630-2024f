# Perspective paper

In this course, you will write a perspective article on a critical debate in computational biology.
This assignment aims to develop your ability to analyze complex scientific issues, form well-reasoned arguments, and articulate your viewpoint supported by current research.
You will:

-   Choose one of the provided [perspective primers](./primers.md), each presenting a nuanced question in computational biology.
-   Write a detailed, well-supported perspective on your chosen topic (5-7 pages, excluding cover page, references, tables, and figures).

## Objective

Your task is to research your chosen topic thoroughly, present a balanced argument considering multiple viewpoints, and provide a well-reasoned perspective supported by current scientific evidence.
This paper should demonstrate your critical thinking skills and ability to synthesize complex information in computational biology.

## Key Components

While you have flexibility in structuring your paper, consider including these elements:

1.  **Introduction:** Set the context, highlight the topic's significance, and present your main argument.
2.  **Background:** Provide necessary scientific context and key concepts.
3.  **Current State of Research:** Summarize relevant findings and identify trends or conflicts in the literature.
4.  **Your Perspective:** Present your viewpoint, supported by evidence from your research.
5.  **Implications and Future Directions:** Discuss the potential impact of your perspective and suggest areas for further research.
6.  **Conclusion:** Synthesize your main points and reinforce your stance.

Remember to maintain a scholarly tone while engaging your audience of peers and instructors who have foundational knowledge of computational biology.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your paper will be evaluated based on:

-   Depth of research and understanding of the topic
-   Quality and relevance of supporting evidence
-   Clarity and coherence of your argument
-   Critical analysis and original thinking
-   Adherence to academic writing standards and provided guidelines

We encourage you to approach this assignment as an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to ongoing debates in computational biology.
Good luck with your research and writing!
