# Introduction

The introduction to your scientific perspective article serves multiple crucial functions, each contributing to engaging your reader and setting the stage for your arguments.

## Purpose

First and foremost, it sets the context for your perspective.
This means providing the reader with the necessary background information to understand where your ideas fit within the broader landscape of computational biology.
You're essentially creating a map for your readers, showing them the terrain of your field and where your perspective will be situated within it.

Highlighting the significance of your topic is another key purpose.
Here, you're answering the "so what?" question.
Why should readers care about your perspective?
What makes it relevant and important?
This could involve explaining how your topic relates to current challenges in the field, its potential impact on future research, or its implications for practical applications in areas like medicine or biotechnology.

The introduction should also briefly outline the current state of the field.
This serves as a snapshot of where research stands today, providing a foundation for your readers to understand how your perspective contributes to, or challenges, existing knowledge.
It's not meant to be an exhaustive literature review, but rather a concise overview that sets up the need for your perspective.

Presenting your main argument or viewpoint is perhaps the most critical purpose of the introduction.
This is where you clearly state your thesis&mdash;the core idea or perspective that your article will develop.
It's like planting a flag that declares your position and gives readers a clear understanding of what to expect from the rest of your article.

Finally, the introduction should outline the structure of your article.
This acts as a roadmap for your readers, giving them a preview of how you'll develop your argument throughout the paper.
It helps orient your audience and allows them to follow your reasoning more easily as they progress through your article.

By fulfilling these purposes, your introduction not only informs your readers about what they're about to read, but also engages their interest and prepares them to critically consider your perspective.
It's the foundation upon which the rest of your article builds, making it a crucial component of your scientific perspective piece.

## Instructions

1.  Cite key literature:
   -   Reference seminal papers in your field
   -   Include recent breakthrough studies
   -   Cite works that directly support or contrast with your perspective
   -   Use citations to demonstrate field knowledge and provide context
   -   Be selective; focus on the most relevant and impactful works

## Opening statement

**Optimal length:** 1 to 2 sentences

The opening statement in a computational biology presentation or paper serves three crucial functions: it immediately engages your audience, establishes the context and relevance of your topic, and sets the tone for your perspective or presentation.
A well-crafted opening can captivate your listeners or readers, making them eager to learn more about your specific study area.

When crafting your opening statement, aim for conciseness and relevance. Your statement should be focused and directly related to your specific area in computational biology, ideally expressed in one or two sentences.
Clarity and precision are essential; avoid unnecessary jargon that might confuse undergraduates who may not be familiar with highly specialized terms.

There are several practical approaches you can take with your opening statement.

- One option is highlighting a significant recent trend or advancement in your subfield. For example, you might note how recent advances in single-cell RNA sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity in complex tissues.
- Alternatively, briefly describe a current limitation or challenge that your perspective addresses. An illustration of this approach might be: "Despite the wealth of genomic data available, interpreting the functional impact of genetic variations remains a significant challenge in personalized medicine."
- A third option is to summarize the state of research in your particular area of focus, such as explaining how the integration of machine learning techniques with structural biology has opened new avenues for protein structure prediction and drug design.

Whichever approach you choose, ensure that your statement provides a clear foundation for the rest of your perspective.
It should create a logical bridge between your opening and the main body of your presentation, setting the stage for a more detailed discussion.

When tailoring your opening for an undergraduate audience, use language and concepts appropriate for their level of understanding. If you need to introduce specialized terms, consider briefly defining them to ensure all students can follow your argument from the beginning.

There are several pitfalls to avoid when crafting your opening statement.
Avoid making overly broad statements about computational biology as a whole; instead, focus on your specific area of expertise.
Avoid using attention-grabbing facts or questions that might seem gimmicky or disconnected from your main topic.
Also, be wary of clich√©s or overused phrases in scientific communication, as these can make your opening stale or unoriginal.

While maintaining a professional tone, try to spark curiosity or intrigue about your specific topic.
Consider ending your opening with a subtle hook leading to the rest of your presentation, encouraging your audience to stay engaged.
To illustrate these principles, consider the following examples of effective opening statements:

1. For a talk on network biology: "The rise of high-throughput interaction data has transformed our view of cellular systems from linear pathways to complex, interconnected networks."
2. For a perspective on genomic data privacy: "As genomic sequencing becomes increasingly accessible, protecting individual genetic privacy while enabling valuable research has emerged as a critical challenge in bioinformatics."
3. For a presentation on computational drug discovery: "The synergy between artificial intelligence and molecular modeling is accelerating the identification of potential drug candidates, promising to revolutionize the pharmaceutical industry."

Each of these openings succinctly introduces a specific area of computational biology, hints at its importance or a current challenge, and sets the stage for a more in-depth discussion.

## Background funnel

**Optimal length:** 6 to 8 sentences

The background funnel serves as a critical bridge between your opening statement and the main body of your work.
Its primary purpose is to provide essential context and gradually guide your audience from broad, foundational concepts to your specific research focus.
This section should ideally span 6 to 8 sentences, balancing comprehensiveness and concision.

Begin your background funnel with a general statement about the relevant computational biology topics.
This broad opening sets the stage for your work within the larger field. From there, gradually narrow your focus, guiding the reader towards your particular subfield and eventually to your specific topic.
This "funnel" approach helps readers understand how your work fits into the broader context of computational biology.

As you construct your funnel, provide a brief history of your topic, highlighting its importance within computational biology.
Include key discoveries or milestones that have led to the current state of research.
This historical context not only educates your audience but also demonstrates the field's evolving nature and the significance of ongoing work.

Throughout this section, explain critical concepts necessary for understanding your perspective.
Be mindful of your undergraduate audience; while you should maintain a scholarly tone, ensure that your explanations are accessible to a broad scientific audience, not just specialists in your area.
If you need to use specialized jargon, briefly explain these terms to keep your work inclusive.

Aim for conciseness and informativeness in your writing. Provide essential background without overwhelming detail, ensuring that each sentence serves a clear purpose in building understanding. Avoid tangents or overly lengthy explanations that might distract from your main points.

As you approach the end of your background funnel, clearly state the purpose and scope of your article or presentation. Explain why this particular aspect of computational biology is worthy of discussion, setting the stage for the detailed exploration in your work's main body. This final narrowing prepares your audience for the specific arguments or findings you'll present.

Key considerations:

1. Ensure a smooth flow of ideas from broad to specific, with each sentence logically leading to the next.
2. Provide enough context for understanding to maintain focus on your specific topic.
3. Be mindful of your audience's background, explaining concepts appropriately for undergraduates.
4. Use precise language to convey complex ideas efficiently within the 6-8 sentence constraint.
5. End with a clear link to your specific research question or topic, setting up the rest of your presentation or paper.

## Current gaps

**Optimal length:** 4 to 6 sentences

After providing an overview of the current state of research, focus on identifying one or two main challenges, gaps, or controversies in your field.
These issues should be directly relevant to your work and represent significant areas where current understanding or methodologies fall short.
As you describe these challenges, briefly indicate how your perspective relates to them.
This connection should be clear but concise, giving your audience a sense of how your work fits into the larger scientific conversation without delving into the specifics of your approach.

It's crucial to establish a clear link between the challenges you've identified and your research focus.
This link serves to justify the importance and relevance of your work.
However, exercise restraint in this section; avoid the temptation to explain your approach or findings fully.
Your goal here is to pique interest and establish context, not to present your complete argument or methodology.
A detailed explanation of your approach will come later in your presentation or paper, where you can explore your methods and findings in depth.
