# Tables and Figures

-   A sample figure is included at the end of the template.
-   Only have one table or figure per page.
-   Tables are placed first and sequentially numbered; then figures are placed last and sequentially numbered.
    For example, `Table 1`, `Table 2`, `Figure 1`, etc.
-   Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
-   If the table or figure is from an article, include the original figure legend and place it within a textbox with a border.
-   You do not necessarily have to include the entire table or figure (e.g., you might show Panel A of the original figure).
-   Write your own figure legend, placing it outside of the box.
-   Make sure to cite the reference in the caption.
