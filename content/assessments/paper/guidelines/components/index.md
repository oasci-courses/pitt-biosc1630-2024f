# Components

Your perspective article will consist of several key sections, each serving a distinct purpose in presenting your analysis and insights.
By following this structure, you will create a comprehensive and cohesive article that not only contributes meaningfully to the discourse in computational biology but also values and integrates the perspectives of your peers.

Remember, while the format provides a framework, the strength of your article lies in your ability to synthesize information, think critically about the subject matter, and present a well-reasoned perspective on your chosen topic.
As you write, consider your audience your peers, who may have foundational knowledge of computational biology but may not be experts in your topic.

## 1. Introduction

Purpose: To engage your reader, provide context, and clearly state your perspective.

Key components:

- Opening statement: Capture attention with a thought-provoking fact, question, or statement related to your topic.
- Background funnel: Start broad and gradually narrow down to your specific focus area.
- Current gaps: Identify the limitations or unanswered questions in the current research.
- Your perspective (thesis): Clearly state your main argument or hypothesis.
- Article structure: Briefly outline the main sections of your paper.

Advice:

- Keep your introduction concise but informative.
- Ensure your thesis is clear, specific, and debatable.
- Use language that is accessible to a broad audience within computational biology.

## 2. Field Overview

Purpose: To provide a comprehensive background of your topic, demonstrating your understanding of the field.

Key components:

- Key concepts: Define and explain fundamental terminology and ideas.
- Current state of the field: Summarize recent breakthroughs and ongoing research.
- Major debates: Present different viewpoints objectively.
- Relevance and potential impacts: Discuss why your topic matters in the broader context of computational biology.

Advice:

- Use a mix of seminal works and recent publications to show the evolution of ideas.
- Organize this section with clear subheadings for easy navigation.
- Maintain an objective tone when presenting different viewpoints.

## 3. Your Perspective (Core Argument)

Purpose: To present and defend your unique perspective on the topic.

Key components:

- Clearly restate your main argument or hypothesis.
- Present evidence supporting your perspective.
- Address potential counterarguments.
- Discuss the implications of your perspective.

Advice:

- Use a logical structure to build your argument.
- Support each point with evidence from your research.
- Anticipate and address potential criticisms or alternative viewpoints.
- Explain how your perspective advances the field or offers new insights.

## 4. Case Studies or Examples

Purpose: To illustrate your perspective with concrete, real-world applications.

Key components:

- Select 2-3 relevant case studies or examples.
- Describe each case study in detail.
- Analyze how each example supports your perspective.
- Connect the examples back to your main argument.

Advice:

- Choose diverse examples to show the breadth of your perspective's applicability.
- Be specific in your analysis, avoiding vague generalizations.
- Explain why these particular examples are significant.

## 5. Future Directions

Purpose: To demonstrate the potential impact and longevity of your perspective.

Key components:

- Discuss potential future research based on your perspective.
- Identify open questions or challenges in the field.
- Propose potential solutions or approaches.

Advice:

- Be speculative but ground your ideas in current research and trends.
- Consider both short-term and long-term implications.
- Discuss how your perspective could shape future work in the field.

## 6. Conclusion

Purpose: To summarize your argument and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

Key components:

- Summarize key points from each section.
- Restate your main argument.
- Emphasize the significance of your perspective.
- End with a thought-provoking statement or call to action.

Advice:

- Avoid introducing new information in the conclusion.
- Reinforce the importance of your perspective in the broader context of computational biology.
- Leave the reader with something to ponder or a clear next step for the field.

## 7. References

Purpose: To give credit to your sources and provide a resource for further reading.

Advice:

- Follow APA format consistently.
- Include a mix of primary research articles, review papers, and books.
- Ensure all in-text citations correspond to entries in your reference list.
