# References

-   Place your references starting on a new page after the conclusions with a `References` heading.
-   Use the [authorâ€“date citation system](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) in the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references).
-   References should be sorted alphabetically and not numbered.
-   Pages do not count towards the requirement.
-   Every reference must have a DOI.
    This excludes most webpages unless they are archived and version controlled.
