# Current State of the Field

-   Summarize the key findings from the papers provided in your chosen theme
-   Discuss how these papers collectively contribute to our understanding of the topic
-   Highlight any conflicting results or interpretations among the papers
-   Identify emerging trends or patterns in the research

-   This section should be split into sections starting with a heading.
-   Body should follow directly the last paragraph of your introduction rather than start a new page.
-   You may use subheadings if necessary.
-   All headings should be [assertion statements](resources:presenting:design-frameworks), not broad headings such as "Results" or "Model overview".
-   You should present and discuss key methods, data, and analysis.
    No additional context/motivation of the research should be included at the beginning; that still belongs in the introduction.
-   Include unifying themes or overarching results, weaknesses, gaps, or inconsistencies so that you are not simply summarizing papers.
