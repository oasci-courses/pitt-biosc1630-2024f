## Contents

This guide outlines the structure and requirements for writing a perspective article in computational biology. You will be tasked with crafting a thoughtful, well-researched piece that demonstrates your understanding of a specific topic within the field. Your article should be 5–7 pages long (excluding the cover page, references, tables, and figures) following the above typesetting format requirements. The topic must be based on one of the provided themes and associated papers discussed in class.

Your perspective article will consist of several key sections, each serving a distinct purpose in presenting your analysis and insights.
These sections include:

-   Introduction,
-   Current State of the Field,
-   Key Challenges and Limitations,
-   Future Directions and Opportunities,
-   Conclusion, and
-   References.

Additionally, you may include relevant figures or tables to support your discussion.

Each section has specific guidelines and objectives, which are detailed below.
By following this structure, you will create a comprehensive and cohesive article that contributes meaningfully to the discourse in computational biology.

Remember, while the format provides a framework, the strength of your article lies in your ability to synthesize information, think critically about the subject matter, and present a well-reasoned perspective on your chosen topic.
As you write, consider your audience to be your peers and instructors who have a foundational knowledge of computational biology but may not be experts in your specific topic.

## Cover Page

The cover page should present the title, your name, course title, version (`Draft 1`, `Draft 2`, `Final Paper`), and the date of the paper.

## Introduction

The introduction to your scientific perspective article serves multiple crucial functions, each contributing to engaging your reader and setting the stage for your arguments.

### Purpose

First and foremost, it sets the context for your perspective.
This means providing the reader with the necessary background information to understand where your ideas fit within the broader landscape of computational biology.
You're essentially creating a map for your readers, showing them the terrain of your field and where your perspective will be situated within it.

Highlighting the significance of your topic is another key purpose.
Here, you're answering the "so what?" question.
Why should readers care about your perspective?
What makes it relevant and important?
This could involve explaining how your topic relates to current challenges in the field, its potential impact on future research, or its implications for practical applications in areas like medicine or biotechnology.

The introduction should also briefly outline the current state of the field.
This serves as a snapshot of where research stands today, providing a foundation for your readers to understand how your perspective contributes to or challenges existing knowledge.
It's not meant to be an exhaustive literature review, but rather a concise overview that sets up the need for your perspective.

Presenting your main argument or viewpoint is perhaps the most critical purpose of the introduction.
This is where you clearly state your thesis&mdash;the core idea or perspective that your article will develop.
It's like planting a flag that declares your position and gives readers a clear understanding of what to expect from the rest of your article.

Finally, the introduction should outline the structure of your article.
This acts as a roadmap for your readers, giving them a preview of how you'll develop your argument throughout the paper.
It helps orient your audience and allows them to follow your reasoning more easily as they progress through your article.

By fulfilling these purposes, your introduction not only informs your readers about what they're about to read, but also engages their interest and prepares them to critically consider your perspective.
It's the foundation upon which the rest of your article builds, making it a crucial component of your scientific perspective piece.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this guide?

The introduction sets the stage for your perspective article, providing context and establishing the significance of your chosen topic within computational biology.
This section should:

-   Begin with a broad overview of the field, gradually narrowing down to your specific topic.
-   Provide historical context, highlighting key discoveries or milestones that led to the current state of research.
-   Clearly state the purpose and scope of your article, explaining why this particular aspect of computational biology is worthy of discussion.
-   Outline the structure of your article, briefly mentioning each main section to guide the reader.
-   End with a clear thesis statement that encapsulates the main argument or perspective you will present.

## Current State of the Field

-   Summarize the key findings from the papers provided in your chosen theme
-   Discuss how these papers collectively contribute to our understanding of the topic
-   Highlight any conflicting results or interpretations among the papers
-   Identify emerging trends or patterns in the research

-   This section should be split into sections starting with a heading.
-   Body should follow directly the last paragraph of your introduction rather than start a new page.
-   You may use subheadings if necessary.
-   All headings should be [assertion statements](resources:presenting:design-frameworks), not broad headings such as "Results" or "Model overview".
-   You should present and discuss key methods, data, and analysis.
    No additional context/motivation of the research should be included at the beginning; that still belongs in the introduction.
-   Include unifying themes or overarching results, weaknesses, gaps, or inconsistencies so that you are not simply summarizing papers.

## Key Challenges and Limitations

-   Analyze the primary obstacles facing research in this area
-   Discuss methodological limitations identified in the papers
-   Explore conceptual challenges that hinder progress in the field
-   Consider ethical, computational, or data-related issues relevant to the topic

## Future Directions and Opportunities

-   Propose potential solutions to the challenges identified
-   Suggest new research questions or hypotheses based on current findings
-   Discuss emerging technologies or methods that could advance the field
-   Explore potential interdisciplinary approaches or collaborations

## Conclusions

-   This section should be preceded by a heading (`Conclusions`).
-   Conclusions should immediately follow your last paragraph of the body rather than start a new page.
-   Summarize unifying themes and over-arching results from the evidence presented above.
-   Summarize any weaknesses, gaps, or potential inconsistencies.
-   Suggest future directions of the research.
-   Length of conclusions should be 0.5--1 page.

## References

-   Place your references starting on a new page after the conclusions with a `References` heading.
-   Use the [author–date citation system](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/citations/basic-principles/author-date) in the [APA style](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/references).
-   References should be sorted alphabetically and not numbered.
-   Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
-   Every reference must have a DOI.
    This excludes most webpages unless they are archived and version controlled.

## Tables and Figures

-   A sample figure is included at the end of the template.
-   Only have one table or figure per page.
-   Tables are placed first and sequentially numbered; then figures are placed last and sequentially numbered.
    For example, `Table 1`, `Table 2`, `Figure 1`, etc.
-   Pages do not count towards the 7--9 page text requirement.
-   If the table or figure is from an article, include the original figure legend and place it within a textbox with a border.
-   You do not necessarily have to include the entire table or figure (e.g., you might show Panel A of the original figure).
-   Write your own figure legend, placing it outside of the box.
-   Make sure to cite the reference in the caption.

## Style

Your paper should cater to the [intermediate audience](presentation:audience:intermediate).

Everyone has their own preferred style of writing.
While many things are subject to taste, there are still some suggested guidelines one should follow when possible.

!!! note
    This is a work in progress.

-   Avoid using `I` in your writing whenever possible.
    In a perspective article, it's acceptable to use a more personal tone.
    While you should still maintain academic rigor, you can use phrases like "In our view," or "We propose" when presenting your unique insights or interpretations.
-   Make sure to clearly distinguish between established facts from the literature and your own interpretations or proposals.
-   Citations should always go before the period (i.e., left) instead of after.
    In-text citations are treated as part of the sentence.
    When writing for a scientific journal, you follow whatever their guidelines state.
-   Use strong, clear language to articulate your perspective, but always support your points with evidence from the provided papers or other relevant sources.
-   For every sentence, ask yourself how a grumpy old scientist would respond.

    > Computational biology is revolutionizing our understanding of the world around us.

    A grumpy scientist could think, "Oh, good, like I didn't already know this and read five papers with this same introduction."
    Use this to guide if your statement is too broad.
-   When listing items with `(1)`, `(a)`, etc. make sure to add a `,` or `;`.
    For example, there is something to (a) show, (b) tell, (c) and see.
-   The [Oxford comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma) is strongly recommended.
-   Avoid absolute or general statements like "best", "worst", "wrong", "only", etc. when someone could make an argument about some other approach being superior.
    For example, instead of

    > We chose to use the ff19SB force field because it is the best for our system.

    You can say,

    > Our MD simulations employed the ff19SB force field because previous publications [8, 9] have demonstrated its high performance for similar proteins.

    Instead of saying,

    > Molecular dynamics is the best method.

    you can say,

    > Molecular dynamics has shown promising results in similar studies.
-   It is important to have variety in your sentence structure and length.
    For example, have some short sentences, some longer ones, use semicolons, em dashes, etc.
    Variety makes it easier to read and maintain focus.
-   Minimize the amount of jumping around the reader has to do to follow your paper.
    For example, do not include a glossary at the end of your paper for technical terms.
    Explain them concisely in your writing.
