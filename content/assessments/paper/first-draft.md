## Objective

Before turning in a complete draft of your paper later in the semester, this assignment will have you create an outline/partial draft.
Making a complete outline helps you:

-   plan what needs to be written;
-   see the flow of your paper;
-   identify knowledge or content gaps.

## Grading

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria.
Each criterion has four ratings:

-   **Satisfactory** (100%):
  This rating indicates that the work meets the acceptable standards.
-   **Room for improvement** (80%):
  The work would benefit from refinement, additional details, or improved execution.
-   **Insufficient** (50%):
  The work does not meet the basic requirements and requires substantial revisions or corrections.
-   **Absent** (0%):
  No evaluation of the work is possible (i.e., missing).

## Instructions

:::{tip}
At this point, we are at the drafting stage.
Your aim for this assignment should not be crafting perfect sentences but to get words and thoughts on the page.
In later assignments, you can restructure and polish them in the writing and editing stage.

### Formatting

Use the [formatting guidelines](paper:guidelines) to structure your paper.

#### Rubric

-   **Paper follows all formatting guidelines**
    -   Satisfactory (0.5 points)
    -   Room for improvement (0.4 points)
    -   Insufficient (0.25 points)
    -   Absent (0.0 points)

### Title

Provide a descriptive title that indicates your topic.
It should be different than your focus paper but still communicate the key points.
You can change this later, so spend only a little time on this.

    -   Satisfactory (0.5 points)
    -   Room for improvement (0.4 points)
    -   Insufficient (0.25 points)
    -   Absent (0.0 points)

### Introduction

In paragraph format, write your introduction following the [three moves of the CARS model](cars-introduction).
For now, this should be about 0.75 to 1.0 pages.
You will be expanding on this in future drafts.

Be sure to provide citations for background information.
If you cite a primary literature article, the implication is that the article provides the evidence for your statement; do not cite a primary literature article for general information you learned in the introduction.
Instead, find a review article that you can cite for general information or the appropriate primary literature for specific details.

#### Rubric

-   **Introduction contains a well-written CARS move one**
    -   Satisfactory (0.5 points)
    -   Room for improvement (0.4 points)
    -   Insufficient (0.25 points)
    -   Absent (0.0 points)
-   **Introduction contains a well-written CARS move two**
    -   Satisfactory (0.5 points)
    -   Room for improvement (0.4 points)
    -   Insufficient (0.25 points)
    -   Absent (0.0 points)
-   **Introduction contains a well-written CARS move three**
    -   Satisfactory (0.5 points)
    -   Room for improvement (0.4 points)
    -   Insufficient (0.25 points)
    -   Absent (0.0 points)
