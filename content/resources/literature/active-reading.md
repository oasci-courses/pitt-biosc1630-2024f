# Active reading

Below is a list of some possible active reading techniques students can use.
Demonstrate a few of these techniques with examples in a presentation format.

- **Preview the text:**
  Before diving into the article, scan the title, abstract, headings, subheadings, figures, and tables.
  This preview provides an overview and helps you identify the main topics and key points.
-   **Highlight and annotate:**
    Use highlighting or underlining to mark important passages, key terms, and evidence.
    Write brief annotations or comments in the margins to clarify your understanding or ask questions.

        Use highlighting and annotation sparingly.
        It rarely helps solidify your understanding of an article.
        It is beneficial when you are reviewing an article to refresh its content.

- **Summarize paragraphs:**
  After reading a paragraph or section, pause and summarize it in your own words.
  This influences you to process and internalize the information before moving on.
- **Ask questions:**
  Formulate questions as you read.
  What is the research question?
  How was the study conducted?
  What are the main findings?
  Asking and answering questions actively engages your critical thinking.
- **Pause and reflect:**
  Periodically pause and reflect on your reading.
  Consider how the current section relates to the overall research or the paper's central argument.
- **Make connections:**
  Relate the new information to your existing knowledge or experiences.
  Connecting new content to what you already know enhances comprehension and retention.
- **Challenge yourself:**
  When facing unfamiliar terms or concepts, challenge yourself to look them up or seek additional resources to gain a deeper understanding.
- **Discuss with peers:**
  Discuss the article's content with classmates or colleagues.
  Sharing perspectives and insights can clarify your understanding and uncover different interpretations.
- **Revisit and review:**
  Revise your notes and annotations after completing the reading.
  Summarize the main points and key takeaways.
  Revisiting the material improves retention.
- **Teach or explain to others:**
  Share what you've learned with someone, such as a peer or mentor.
  Teaching or explaining concepts to others reinforces your understanding.
