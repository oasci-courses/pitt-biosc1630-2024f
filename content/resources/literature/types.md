# Types of scientific literature

## Primary

A primary research article, often simply referred to as a "research article," is a fundamental type of scientific literature that presents the original research conducted by the authors.
These articles report on new findings, experiments, and studies conducted by researchers to answer specific research questions or test hypotheses.
Primary research articles play a crucial role in advancing scientific knowledge by sharing novel discoveries and contributing to the ongoing discourse within a field.

Key characteristics of a primary research article include:

- **Original research:**
  Primary research articles document research that is conducted firsthand by the authors.
  This involves designing and executing experiments, collecting data, analyzing results, and drawing conclusions based on the data.
- **Standard format:**
  They typically follow a structured format that includes sections such as Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (commonly known as IMRAD).
  This format ensures consistency across articles and helps readers easily locate specific information.
- **Introduction:**
  The introduction section of a primary research article provides background information on the research topic, outlines the research question or objective, and establishes the context for the study.
- **Methods:**
  The methods section details the experimental design, materials used, data collection procedures, and statistical or analytical methods applied.
  This section allows other researchers to understand and replicate the study if necessary.
- **Results:**
  The results section presents the findings of the research, often utilizing tables, graphs, figures, and other visual aids to convey the data.
  This section is focused on presenting raw data without extensive interpretation.
- **Discussion:**
  In the discussion section, authors interpret their results, relate them to existing knowledge in the field, discuss implications, and sometimes propose future research directions.
- **Citations:**
  Primary research articles include citations to previously published research that influenced the study's design, methods, or interpretation.
  Proper citation acknowledges the contributions of other researchers and situates the study within the broader context of existing knowledge.

Primary research articles in computational biology often focus on developing and applying computational techniques for analyzing biological data.
These articles can illuminate underlying biological mechanisms and help advance our understanding of complex biological systems.
They can also introduce new tools that can enhance other researchersâ€™ work.
By reading primary research articles, students and researchers in computational biology can stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and learn about innovative techniques and approaches.

## Review

A review article is a type of scientific literature that aims to provide a comprehensive and synthesized overview of existing research on a specific topic.
Unlike primary research articles that report original research findings, review articles analyze and compile information from various primary sources to present a coherent understanding of a particular subject.
They serve as valuable resources for researchers, students, and professionals who seek to gain an in-depth understanding of a specific area of knowledge without going through many primary research papers.

Key characteristics of a review article include:

- **Comprehensive analysis:**
  Review articles offer a broad survey of the research landscape within a defined topic area.
  They aim to cover significant research findings, methodologies, trends, controversies, and gaps in the field.
- **Integration of research:**
  Authors of review articles gather information from multiple primary research articles, often spanning different studies, experiments, and authors.
  This integration allows them to synthesize and consolidate the findings into a coherent narrative.
- **Objective presentation:**
  Review articles may include the author's interpretations but generally maintain a balanced and objective tone.
  The focus is on presenting the collective knowledge within the field rather than advancing new hypotheses or experimental data.
- **Structured format:**
  Similar to primary research articles, review articles often follow a structured format.
  This typically includes an introduction that outlines the scope and purpose of the review, sections that delve into various aspects of the topic, and a conclusion that summarizes the essential findings and suggests potential future directions for research.
- **Citation of primary sources:**
  Proper citation is a crucial aspect of review articles.
  Authors must provide citations for the primary research articles and studies they reference.
  This allows readers to trace back to the sources to explore specific topics in more detail.

Review articles are particularly beneficial in several ways:

- **Efficient overview:**
  They provide a concise and organized overview of a complex topic, saving readers time and effort in sifting through numerous primary sources.
- **Identifying trends and gaps:**
  Review articles often highlight the evolution of ideas within a field, identify gaps in knowledge, and suggest potential research directions.
- **Educational resource:**
  Review articles are helpful educational tools for students and newcomers to a field, as they offer a solid foundation for understanding the state of current knowledge.
- **Clarifying controversies:**
  Review articles can help readers understand ongoing debates and controversies within a field by presenting multiple perspectives and interpretations.

## Opinion

An opinion piece, also known as an opinion article, is a type of written content that expresses the author's personal viewpoints, interpretations, hypotheses, or reflections on a particular topic.
Opinions are distinct from primary research and review articles in research and academia.
While primary research articles present original research findings and review articles synthesize existing research, opinion pieces offer subjective perspectives, insights, or arguments related to a specific subject within a field.

Key characteristics of an opinion piece in research include:

- **Subjective interpretation:**
  Unlike primary research articles that rely on empirical data and evidence and review articles that synthesize existing research, opinion pieces are inherently subjective.
  They reflect the author's viewpoints and interpretations.
- **Engagement with ideas:**
  Opinion pieces often engage with broader concepts, theories, controversies, or trends within a field.
  Authors may provide critical analyses, propose alternative explanations, challenge prevailing norms, or speculate about future directions.
- **Exploratory nature:**
  Opinion pieces are exploratory in nature.
  Authors use them as platforms to brainstorm ideas, encourage dialogue, and spark further investigation into specific topics.
- **Less formal structure:**
  While primary research and review articles follow structured formats, opinion pieces may have a more flexible structure.
  However, they typically include an introduction that sets the context, a body presenting the author's argument or perspective, and a conclusion summarizing key points.
- **Use of rhetorical devices:**
  Authors of opinion pieces may use rhetorical devices such as anecdotes, metaphors, and persuasive language to effectively engage readers and convey their perspectives.
- **Stimulating discussion:**
  Opinion pieces often serve as catalysts for discussion, inviting readers to consider alternative viewpoints and engage in thoughtful debate.
- **Varied audience:**
  Opinion pieces can target experts within a field and a wider audience interested in the topic.
  They bridge the gap between specialized research and general public interest.

Opinion pieces play a valuable role in research and academia by contributing to intellectual discourse, expanding the range of perspectives, and fostering critical thinking.
They allow researchers to speculate, propose novel ideas, and challenge conventional wisdom.
