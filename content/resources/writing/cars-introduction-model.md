# CARS introduction model

Introductions must capture the research's essence while establishing significance within the broader scientific landscape.
The Create a Research Space (CARS) model, developed by [John Swales](https://lsa.umich.edu/linguistics/people/faculty/professors-emeriti/jmswales.html), defines a strategic approach to writing introductions.
A CARS introduction is a well-crafted roadmap that introduces the topic, establishes its relevance, positions it within existing research, and sets the stage for your unique contribution.

It is broken into three moves, discussed below.

-   [Move 1: Establishing a territory](#move-1-establishing-a-territory)
-   [Move 2: Defining your niche](#move-2-defining-your-niche)
-   [Move 3: Occupying the niche](#move-3-occupying-the-niche)

## Move 1: Establishing a territory

In scientific writing, authors will establish the significance and relevance of their research.
During this literature review phase, writers engage with existing scholarly work by envisioning it as an ongoing academic dialogue.
Writers structure their synthesis of past research, positioning themselves thoughtfully within the scholarly conversation surrounding their topic.

### Setting the field

The initial task in crafting an effective introduction is concisely summarizing the field under investigation.
This brief yet crucial opening primes the reader for what lies ahead in the article.
It serves as a compass, centering them toward the core concepts and motivation of the research.

### Defining the field of study

Following this, it's essential to furnish the reader with the necessary background information about the topic.
This includes fundamental knowledge crucial for comprehending the central ideas and issues addressed throughout the article.

### Relevance and interest

Now, the introduction should transition into demonstrating the topic's relevance or interest in the real world or within contemporary research.
This contextualization illuminates the practical implications or scholarly significance of the subject matter.
In this section, you answer the question, "Why does this research matter?"

### Referencing previous research

As mentioned earlier, refer to previous research conducted within the field.
This substantiates your understanding of the subject and connects your work to the broader scholarly conversation.

## Move 2: Defining your niche

In academic writing, authors highlight two key aspects:

-   identify gaps or deficiencies in existing research and
-   emphasize the necessity for further exploration or validation.

Writers then discern areas where previous work may fall short or require further investigation.
They refine and evolve the broader body of knowledge on their chosen topic.

### Making a Counter-Claim

A pivotal step in a Swalesian introduction involves carving out a unique niche for your research.
This can be accomplished by presenting a counter-claim or opposing viewpoint.
By highlighting limitations or flaws in existing research, you pave the way for your distinctive contribution to the field.

### Identifying a Research Gap

Alternatively, you can establish your niche by identifying a deficiency in prior research.
This approach emphasizes the uncharted territory you intend to explore, such as areas with little prior research.

### Continuing the Inquiry

Another option for carving out your niche is to propose building upon existing research.
Acknowledge the conclusions drawn by previous scholars and then use a connector statement to bridge it with your work.
This demonstrates your commitment to extending the research within the field.

## Move 3: Occupying the niche

Writers show how their work resolves (or, in the case of a proposal, will resolve) the gap, shortcoming, or limitation in existing work or that it successfully extends or verifies past research.
Imagine that you now have everyone's attention and must explain to fellow scholars how your ideas will add to or move the conversation forward.

### Outlining Objectives

Clearly outlining the objectives of your research is crucial.
This statement should articulate what your study aims to achieve and what the reader can expect to glean from your article.

### Explaining Methodology

While a comprehensive explanation of your methodology is reserved for the body of the article, a brief overview in the introduction gives the reader a preliminary understanding of how you arrived at your conclusions.

### Structural Overview

It's helpful to give the reader a glimpse of the article's organizational structure.
Outlining the main sections and their sequence helps them anticipate the flow of information as they delve further into the article.

### Evaluating Findings

To conclude the introduction, offer a summary of your research findings.
Additionally, discuss how these findings contribute to the existing body of knowledge and hint at potential avenues for future research that your work has uncovered.
