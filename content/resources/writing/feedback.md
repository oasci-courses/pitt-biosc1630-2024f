# Providing and receiving feedback

Feedback is essential for writing and presentations because it promotes personal and professional growth by targeting critical aspects of one’s performance.
With ongoing constructive feedback, an individual can hone in on skill sets in a very organized way.
With feedback, the progression of growth is maintained.
Bad habits are often overlooked and become permanent habits.
Giving up is more likely to occur without proper structure and guidance.

For writing, feedback is important because it helps you improve your writing skills.
It can help you identify areas to improve, such as grammar, punctuation, or sentence structure.
Feedback can also help you develop your ideas and arguments more effectively.
You can learn how to communicate your ideas better and make your writing more engaging and persuasive by receiving feedback from others.
Feedback can also help you develop your own voice as a writer.
By receiving feedback from others, you can learn what works and what doesn’t work in your writing.
This can help you develop a unique style that differentiates you from other writers.

For presentations, feedback can be used as a gauge for audience engagement.
Even a good presentation has at least a few things it can improve on.
Opportunities to grow means feedback to be received.
There will always be feedback to receive, whether positive or negative.
Asking for feedback will also help improve your presentation skills.
When people are asked to give feedback on a presentation, most of the feedback you will receive will be on your delivery or the slides.

Getting helpful feedback can be a critical step---it can also be harder to find than you might expect.
Honest feedback calls on you to be vulnerable and forces your feedback partner sometimes to deliver difficult constructive criticism.
The good news is that deep and authentic feedback can encourage personal growth and a willingness to take creative risks.
So, getting high-quality feedback that elevates your writing and presentation skills is essential.

## Types of feedback

There is no one-size-fits-all for feedback.
While there are common characteristics of effective feedback, the form it takes will change across contexts.

Types of feedback may include corrective, epistemic, suggestive, and epistemic + suggestive [^leibold2015art].

| Type | Purpose | Sample language |
| ---- | ------- | --------------- |
| **Corrective** | Corrective feedback is specific to how well the work aligns with the objectives. This feedback highlights areas where the author met expectations and areas for improvement. | You do a great job addressing `[objective]`. However, the assignment also asked for x, but x is not present. How might you address `[objective]`? |
| **Epistemic** | Epistemic feedback prompts authors to think more deeply about their work. It asks for further clarification, challenging authors to delve deeper into particular ideas. | Could you say more about x? (You may also ask specific questions to which further clarification can or should respond.) |
| **Suggestive** | Suggestive feedback gives authors advice on how to improve upon their work. It also underscores specific areas or ideas for expansion. | Giving an example of `[this concept]` would make your description more straightforward. |
| **Epistemic + Suggestive** | The combination of epistemic and suggestive feedback prompts authors to offer further clarification and specific suggestions. This can be a helpful combination because it asks authors to “say more” and provides specific suggestions for how they might do so. | How did you reach this conclusion? Think about the point you made on page x. |

These particular types of feedback are not exclusive of each other.
Commonly, the feedback you give will have elements of some, if not all, of these four types.
What type you use at what point will depend on the goals, the purpose of the feedback, and the kinds of revisions and responses you are trying to solicit.

## Characteristics of effective feedback

Effective feedback is a cornerstone of successful learning in computational biology, as it plays a pivotal role in guiding students toward improvement and growth.
To ensure that feedback serves its intended purpose, adhering to several guiding principles is crucial.

**Targeted and concise**

One common pitfalls in providing feedback is overwhelming authors with excessive information.
While it's natural to want to cover every aspect of their work, an overflow of feedback can lead to confusion and make it difficult for them to know where to begin.
Identifying and communicating two to four main areas for improvement is advisable.
By distilling your feedback to these core points, you help them focus their efforts on the most crucial aspects.
This approach prevents them from feeling overwhelmed and provides a clear roadmap for their revision process.

**Alignment with objectives**

Feedback should always be tailored to the author's main points to communicate to the audience.
Rather than offering generic advice, link your feedback to the stated goals of the task.
By making these connections, you can better focus on how your feedback contributes to their objectives.
This alignment fosters a deeper understanding of the material and encourages students to engage with the content thoughtfully.

**Action-oriented guidance**

The essence of effective feedback lies in its actionable nature.
Rather than solely identifying flaws, provide the author with clear and specific suggestions for revision.
Highlight particular sections or elements within their work that could benefit from refinement and offer guidance on addressing those areas.
This guidance should be tangible and practical as a step-by-step roadmap to enhance the work.

**Timely feedback iterations**

Feedback must improve effectiveness when provided too close to the final submission deadline.
Be conscious of how much time the author can incorporate your feedback.
Proposing large, substantial changes would not be productive for the author because they may not have enough time.
Instead, establish a feedback loop that allows authors ample time to engage with your comments and make revisions.
Frequent feedback opportunities before the deadline create an iterative process where they can progressively refine their work.
This ongoing engagement facilitates improvements in the specific assignment and nurtures a deeper understanding of the subject matter over time.

## Incorporating feedback

- **Stay open-minded:**
  Approach feedback with an open mindset.
  Recognize that feedback is not a critique of your abilities but an opportunity for improvement.
  A receptive attitude sets the stage for a constructive feedback loop.
- **Review and reflect:**
  Take time to review the feedback you’ve received thoroughly.
  Read through the comments and suggestions carefully, making notes of the key areas highlighted for improvement.
  Reflect on how these areas align with your original goals for the writing or presentation.
- **Prioritize feedback:**
  Not all feedback is created equal.
  Identify the most crucial points mentioned in the feedback.
- **Understand the Context:**
  Contextualize the feedback within the larger scope of your work.
  Understand how the suggestions align with the purpose of your writing or presentation.
  This ensures that your revisions are aligned with your intended message and goals.
- **Plan revisions:**
  Devise a clear plan for incorporating the feedback.
  Break down the revision process into actionable steps.
  This could involve rewriting specific sections, reorganizing content, or enhancing visual aids for presentations.
- **Implement changes:**
  Start making the changes based on the feedback you’ve received.
  Be willing to rework sentences, rearrange paragraphs, or adjust slides.
  Don’t be afraid to experiment with different approaches to see what works best.
- **Seek clarification:**
  If specific feedback points are unclear, seek clarification from the person who provided the feedback.
  Clearing up any uncertainties ensures you make accurate changes and fully grasp the intended suggestions.
- **Proofread and edit:**
  After implementing the changes, proofread and edit your work meticulously.
  Ensure that your revisions flow seamlessly with the rest of the content. Address any grammatical or formatting issues arising during the revision process.
- **Share again for feedback:**
  Please share your revised work with the same or other individuals for further feedback.
  This helps you gauge whether your revisions effectively address the initial concerns and whether the changes enhance the overall quality.
- **Reflect on the process:**
  Take a moment to reflect on the entire feedback and revision process.
  Consider how you’ve evolved as a writer or presenter and the lessons you’ve learned.
  This reflective practice enhances your ability to apply feedback in the future.
- **Apply lessons learned:**
  As you progress with your writing and presentation projects, apply the lessons you’ve learned from previous feedback experiences.
  This ongoing improvement cycle will contribute to your continuous growth and development.
