## Assertion and evidence

This framework segments and simplifies information in a way that improves slides for teaching, conferences, and other presentations.
It is based on the idea that a presentation should be built on messages (not topics) to tell a coherent and compelling story about your work. Those messages are then supported with visual evidence (not bullet lists).
