## Fonts

Use a sans-serif font such as Open Sans, Roboto, Lato, Helvetica, Calibri, etc.
Also, ensure that there is adequate spacing between the letters and words.
Avoid italics or underlining; use bold fonts for emphasis.

## Background

Bright white backgrounds can make text harder to read.
You can either

- use an off-white or cream background,
- or dark background with light text.

## Layout

A colorful, high-contrast graphic layout with pictures and text creates a structured design.
This is easier for people with dyslexia to understand.

## Images

Remember to add Alt Text to every image in your presentation.

## Color

Generally, only include up to three colors on your slides.
Use high-contrast colors that are across from each other (i.e., complementary) on the [color wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

You can use one of these tools to check the contrast.
The contrast ratio should be **at least** 4.5:1 to reach [WACAG Level AA](https://ialabs.ie/what-is-the-difference-between-wcag-a-aa-and-aaa/).

Also, be sure to use a colorblind-friendly pallet.
Here are some tools to help you check this.
