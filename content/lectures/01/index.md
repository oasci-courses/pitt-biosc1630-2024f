<!--
Notes:

-   Need to add explicit slides for the "danger unfinished" as well as give some example in-class activities.
-   Need to mention at some point the presentations.
-   Need to mention my position on ChatGPT.
-   I probably can cut down on the research ecosystem.
-   I think they needed more time to finish this.
-   Activity took a little too long, need to reduce.
-   Students often have class right after, so be sure to always.
