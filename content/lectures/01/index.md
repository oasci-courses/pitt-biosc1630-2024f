## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

1.  Understand course structure and expectations.
2.  Compare and contrast different types of scientific articles and understand how these articles target different audiences.
3.  Learn strategies to find primary research articles that pertain to a question you care about.

## Meet the instructor

**Duration:** 5 minutes

Begin the class with an introduction to the instructor.
This will help the students connect with the instructor and begin a sense of belonging.
Students are likelier to engage with course materials when they feel a personal connection to the instructor.

??? quote "Example information"
    A presentation that could include the following information.

    **Instructor background**

    Begin by sharing information about the instructor's background, including their education, professional experience, and personal information that helps students relate.
    This could include where the instructor grew up, what inspired them to pursue a career in computational biology, and any interesting experiences or achievements.

    **Research interests**

    Discuss research interests and current projects that are relevant to computational biology.
    This could include the topics the instructor is studying, methods, and exciting findings or insights.

    **Teaching philosophy**

    Share the teaching philosophy and approach to the course.
    This could include goals for student learning, beliefs about effective teaching methods, and how to engage students in the course material.

## Course overview

**Duration:** 35 minutes

Provide an overview of the course structure and expectations, including the class format, grading policies, and important dates or deadlines.
This will help students understand what is expected of them and how to succeed in the course.

## Perspective and primers

**Duration:** 20 minutes

Go in depth on the perspective paper and introduce the [perspective primers](../../assessments/paper/primers.md) and [theme assignment](../../assessments/paper/assignments/theme.md).

## Break

**Duration:** 10 minutes

## Bureaucracy and anatomy of research

**Duration:** 30 minutes

Provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the structures and processes that shape scientific inquiry in fields like computational biology.
By exploring funding mechanisms, career paths, publication practices, and impact metrics, students will gain valuable insights into the forces that influence research priorities and career trajectories.

## How to find scientific articles

**Duration:** __ minutes

Finding relevant scientific literature is an essential skill for computational biologists.
By providing strategies for effective searching, you can help students develop the skills to find primary research articles that pertain to their research interests.
Search engines and databases are powerful tools for finding scientific literature.
