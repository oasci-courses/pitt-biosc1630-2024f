**Date:** Aug 28, 2024

## Learning objectives

What you should be able to do after today's lecture:

-   Learn about your instructor.
-   Identify relevant skills for computational biologists.
-   Understand course structure and expectations.
-   Learn guidelines for giving and receiving critical feedback.
-   Compare and contrast different types of scientific articles and understand how these articles target different audiences.
-   Learn strategies to find primary research articles that pertain to a question you care about.

## L1 - Meet the instructor

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Begin the class with an introduction to the instructor.
This will help the students connect with the instructor and begin a sense of belonging.
Students are likelier to engage with course materials when they feel a personal connection to the instructor.

??? quote "Example information"
    A presentation that could include the following information.

    **Instructor background**

    Begin by sharing information about the instructor's background, including their education, professional experience, and personal information that helps students relate.
    This could include where the instructor grew up, what inspired them to pursue a career in computational biology, and any interesting experiences or achievements.

    **Research interests**

    Discuss research interests and current projects that are relevant to computational biology.
    This could include the topics the instructor is studying, methods, and exciting findings or insights.

    **Teaching philosophy**

    Share the teaching philosophy and approach to the course.
    This could include goals for student learning, beliefs about effective teaching methods, and how to engage students in the course material.

## D1 - Skills for computational biologists

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Open up a [Top Hat](https://app.tophat.com) discussion question and prompt the students to submit what skills should a successful computational biologist have.
Make the responses pop-up on the screen with anonymous mode turned on.
As answers are submitted, the instructor should discuss these aspects and add context.
Encourage for everyone to submit something as this will contribute to their participation grade.

After there is a lull in responses, move forward with slides that discuss what the instructor believes are important skills to have.

## L2 - Course overview

**Duration:** 30 minutes

Setting clear expectations for students at the beginning of a course can help them feel more confident and motivated.
By providing a detailed overview of the course structure and expectations, you can help students understand what they need to do to succeed in the course.

Provide an overview of the course structure and expectations, including the class format, grading policies, and important dates or deadlines.
This will help students understand what is expected of them and how to succeed in the course.
