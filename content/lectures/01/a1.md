# Finding literature

**Total duration:** 25 minutes

## Objective

To engage students in a dynamic and interactive in-class activity that cultivates their proficiency in effectively finding, critically evaluating, and utilizing research literature within computational biology.

## Form groups

**Duration:** 1 minute

Have the students split up into groups of two or three.
Ensure at least one student per group has access to the internet via smartphone or laptop.

## Select group topics

**Duration:** 4 minutes

Show the students these options and have them select a single topic from the list below.
At most, two groups can pick the same topic.

TODO: I need to find more specific questions to search for.

1.  **Predictive modeling in drug discovery:** I am studying Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS) and want to know what machine learning methods I could use to identify potential drug candidates.
2.  **Network analysis of biological pathways:** A researcher asked me how to identify essential proteins of Cretzfeldt-Jakob disease using protein-protein interaction networks the other day.
3.  **Metagenomics and microbiome analysis:** I want to write a grant that characterizes the distribution of bacteria in the rivers surrounding Pittsburgh. What are some articles that could help me write this?
4.  **Structural bioinformatics:** Is there a connection between inherently disordered regions in proteins and their function?
5.  **RNA structure and function:** I want to study how noncoding RNA structure can affect Huntington's disease. What methods should I use?
6.  **Systems biology modeling:** Purkinje cell growth and dynamics of granule cell migrations have fascinated me. Could agent-based modeling be helpful?
7.  **Epigenomics analysis:** I discovered that *C. elegans* does not have a conventional DNA methyltransferase. Are there other organisms that follow this pattern?
8.  **Bioinformatics databases:** My colleague developed a new algorithm to analyze gene expression data. What datasets could I test this on?

## Literature search

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Have the groups find supporting literature of any type based on their topic.
They should keep track of the various aspects of their search, such as:

-   search engine used,
-   the query,
-   authors background,
-   usefulness to the topic,
-   critical evaluation of the scientific rigor.

## Sharing

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Bring the class back together to provide each group with a platform to articulate their findings and elucidate the methodologies they employed.
Here are some starter questions.

-   What challenges did you face when trying to find a relevant article?
-   Were there particular search terms that helped identify relevant articles?
-   Did you look at the references and citations of the paper to find more?
-   What are some key aspects that you found that helped you evaluate the credibility?
-   What did or did you not find interesting about your topic?
