Semester Wrap-Up
</h1>
<p align="center"><b>Date: </b>Dec 4, 2024</p>

As we gather for our final session, we'll create a supportive space to reflect on our semester-long journey through computational biology and look ahead to future paths.
This session is designed to be informal and conversational, allowing everyone to share their experiences and thoughts about the road ahead.

## Research Reflections

We'll begin by forming small discussion circles of 4-5 students. This setting allows for meaningful conversation about your research experiences.
Each person will have about three minutes to share their journey - think of this as a casual conversation rather than a presentation.
You might discuss what fascinated you most about your topic, moments that challenged your assumptions, or how your understanding evolved throughout the semester.

Consider sharing:

- An unexpected discovery that shifted your perspective
- A challenging moment that led to growth
- How your understanding of computational biology has evolved
- What you're most proud of accomplishing

Remember, this is a safe space to discuss both successes and struggles. There's no pressure to present formally - we're here to learn from each other's experiences.

## Looking to the Future

In the second part of our session, we'll transition to discussing future aspirations and concerns.
We'll break into groups based on shared interests, whether that's graduate school, industry positions, research careers, or still exploring options.
This is an opportunity to voice both your excitement and anxieties about the path ahead.

Share openly about:

- What excites you about your chosen path
- What keeps you up at night
- Uncertainties you're grappling with
- Support you're seeking
- Resources you've found helpful

For those considering graduate school:

- What programs interest you?
- What aspects of advanced study worry you?
- How do you feel about the application process?
- What support would be most helpful?
- What questions drive your curiosity?
- What aspects of research feel daunting?

For those eyeing industry:

- Which sectors intrigue you?
- What skills make you nervous?
- How do you feel about job searching?
- What networking opportunities interest you?

For those still exploring:

- What options are you considering?
- What factors influence your decision?
- What information would help you decide?
- How can we support your exploration?

## Final Thoughts

Before we part, we'll take time to acknowledge everyone's accomplishments and share final words of encouragement. This is also a chance to complete course evaluations and ask any lingering questions about your future paths.

Remember, this session is about supporting each other as we look to the future.
Share honestly, listen empathetically, and celebrate how far you've come.
Your anxieties and uncertainties are normal and shared by many of your peers - voicing them often helps us find common ground and mutual support.
