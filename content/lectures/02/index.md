**Date:** Sep 4, 2024

## Learning objectives

This lesson plan is designed to actively engage students in developing essential reading and comprehension skills for primary scientific literature.
It incorporates various activities to ensure students understand and practice the concepts hands-on.
By the end of the session, students should feel more confident in their ability to read and critically evaluate research articles in computational biology.

-   Use skimming and scanning techniques.
-   Apply annotation, highlighting, and note-taking methods.
-   Identify research questions, hypotheses, and objectives.
-   Evaluate the significance and relevance of scientific studies.
-   Create concise summaries by synthesizing key information.

## L1 - Speed-reading techniques

**Duration:** 5 minutes

### Rationale

Skimming and scanning techniques help you adsorb critical points and save time.
Speed-reading techniques also assist in determining if more thorough, active reading is beneficial.

### Content

Scientific literature can be time-consuming to read, with dense concepts and jargon.
Understanding an entire article can take hours, depending on your initial grasp of the subject.
People use speed-reading techniques to get an overview of the article to determine if the time investment is worth it.

#### Subvocalization

Subvocalization, often called silent speech, represents the internal dialogue during reading.
It audibly reproduces the words as they are read, facilitating the mind's access to meanings and aiding in comprehension and retention, potentially lightening the cognitive burden.
Subtle movements in the larynx and other speech-related muscles characterize this inner speech.
Unless aided by specialized equipment, readers remain unaware of these movements.

The relationship between subvocalization and reading speed remains a subject of debate.
Speed readers typically argue that subvocalization hinders processing speed and endeavors to eliminate it during reading.
Furthermore, some studies suggest that subvocalization can enhance reading comprehension {cite}`rayner2012psychology`.

#### Scanning

Scanning is a valuable technique for extracting essential information and ideas.
This method involves swiftly moving your eyes down a page, pinpointing specific words and phrases to uncover particular answers or grasp the fundamental main idea.
It can also assist in assessing whether a new resource will address your questions effectively.

To effectively scan, follow these steps:

-   Search for keywords individually while navigating the passage.
-   Rapidly scan the passages until you locate the keyword you are searching for.
-   Carefully read the surrounding material to ascertain if you have found the necessary information.

#### Skimming

Skimming is a reading method that provides a rapid text overview, emphasizing identifying main ideas and key points.
Here are some strategies that you can use specifically for skimming primary literature:

-   Begin by reading the research paper's or article's abstract to grasp the core objectives, methods, and findings.
-   Focus on section headers and summaries to quickly identify the paper's organization and locate key points.
-   Jump to the results and conclusion sections for a concise overview of the study's outcomes and the author's final remarks.
-   Pay attention to figures, tables, or visual representations, as they often encapsulate critical data and trends.
-   Highlight and recognize essential keywords and phrases that convey the central themes and concepts of the research.

## A1 - Reading for gist

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Lead [this activity](activity:read-for-gist).

## D1 - Active reading techniques

**Duration:** 5 minutes

### Rationale

Teaching active reading techniques for scientific literature is driven by compelling reasons.
First, it helps students efficiently navigate dense and complex information commonly found in scientific articles.
Active reading methods enhance comprehension by engaging readers in deeper interactions with the text, encouraging them to question, summarize, and visualize content.
These techniques also foster critical thinking as readers analyze, evaluate, and apply the information, preparing them for success in academia and research.
