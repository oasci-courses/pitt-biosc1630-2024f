<b>Activity</b><br>
Active introduction reading
</h1>

The introduction of a scientific paper sets the stage for the entire study.
It provides context, outlines the problem, and presents the study's objectives.
The SQ3R method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) is an effective active reading strategy that can help you extract maximum value from this crucial section.

## Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

1.  Apply the SQ3R method to read and analyze the introduction of a computational biology paper
2.  Identify key components of an introduction (background, problem statement, objectives)
3.  Formulate relevant questions to guide your reading
4.  Synthesize and summarize the main points of an introduction

## Instructions

### 1. Understanding the SQ3R Method (10 minutes)

Familiarize yourself with each step of the SQ3R method:

- Survey: Quickly skim the text to get an overview
- Question: Formulate questions based on your survey
- Read: Carefully read the text, seeking answers to your questions
- Recite: Summarize the main points in your own words
- Review: Reflect on how the information fits into the broader context of the study

### 2. Applying SQ3R to the Introduction (45 minutes)

#### a. Survey (5 minutes)

- Skim the introduction, paying attention to:
  - Section headings
  - First and last sentences of each paragraph
  - Any bold or italicized text
  - Figures or tables

#### b. Question (10 minutes)

-   Formulate questions based on your survey. Examples might include:
    -   What is the current state of knowledge in this field?
    -   What is the specific problem or gap this study addresses?
    -   What are the main objectives of this study?
    -   What methods or approaches are proposed?

#### c. Read (15 minutes)

- Read the introduction carefully, seeking answers to your questions
- Highlight or annotate key information

#### d. Recite (10 minutes)

- Summarize the main points of the introduction in your own words
- You can do this in writing or by discussing with a partner

#### e. Review (5 minutes)
- Reflect on how the information in the introduction relates to the overall study
- Consider questions like:
  - How does this introduction set up the rest of the paper?
  - What predictions can you make about the methods or results based on this introduction?

### 3. Class Discussion and Synthesis (20 minutes)
- Be prepared to share your experience applying the SQ3R method
- Discuss the key components you identified in the introduction
- Compare the questions you formulated and answers you found with your classmates

### 4. Reflection (10 minutes)
- Reflect on the effectiveness of the SQ3R method for you
- Consider how you might adapt this approach for different types of scientific writing

## SQ3R Template for Introduction Analysis

Use this template to organize your thoughts as you apply the SQ3R method:

| SQ3R Step | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Survey: List key headings, topics, and visual elements |  |
| Question: What questions do you expect this introduction to answer? |  |
| Read: Key points and answers to your questions |  |
| Recite: Summarize the main ideas in your own words |  |
| Review: How does this introduction set up the rest of the study? |  |

## Tips for Effective Application of SQ3R to Introductions

1. Survey: Pay special attention to the structure of the introduction. It often follows a pattern:
   - Background/Context
   - Problem Statement or Knowledge Gap
   - Proposed Solution or Study Objectives

2. Question: Frame questions that address each part of the introduction structure. This helps ensure comprehensive understanding.

3. Read: Look for signpost phrases that indicate important information, such as:
   - "The aim of this study is..."
   - "We hypothesize that..."
   - "To address this problem, we..."

4. Recite: Try explaining the introduction to a classmate. Teaching others is an excellent way to solidify your understanding.

5. Review: Consider creating a concept map or flowchart to visualize how the ideas in the introduction connect to each other and to the broader study.

Remember, the SQ3R method becomes more effective with practice. Apply this technique to other scientific papers you encounter to enhance your reading comprehension skills.
