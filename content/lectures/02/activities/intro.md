<b>Activity</b><br>
Active introduction reading
</h1>

The introduction of a scientific paper sets the stage for the entire study.
It provides context, outlines the problem, and presents the study's objectives.
The SQ3R method (Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review) is an effective active reading strategy that can help you extract maximum value from this crucial section.

## Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

1.  Apply the SQ3R method to read and analyze the introduction of a computational biology paper
2.  Identify key components of an introduction (background, problem statement, objectives)
3.  Formulate relevant questions to guide your reading
4.  Synthesize and summarize the main points of an introduction

## Instructions

### 1. Applying SQ3R

The SQ3R method is a reading comprehension technique designed to help readers effectively process and retain information from written material.
It stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review.
This structured approach encourages active engagement with the text, promoting better understanding and recall of the content.

#### a. Survey (5 minutes)

**With:** Yourself

Begin by surveying the introduction.
Quickly skim through the text, focusing on section headings, the first and last sentences of each paragraph, any emphasized text (bold or italicized), and any figures or tables present.
This initial overview helps you grasp the general structure and main ideas of the introduction.

!!! note "Deliverable"
    While you are surveying, write down and list any key headings, topics, and visual elements.

!!! tip
    Pay special attention to the structure of the introduction.
    It often follows a pattern:

    - Background/Context
    - Problem Statement or Knowledge Gap
    - Proposed Solution or Study Objectives

#### b. Question (10 minutes)

**With:** Your group

Based on your survey, you should write down questions that you expect this introduction to answer.
These questions should guide your subsequent reading and help you engage more deeply with the content.
Consider asking about the

-   the current state of knowledge in the field,
-   the specific problem or gap the study addresses,
-   the main objectives of the research, and
-   the proposed methods or approaches.

#### c. Read (15 minutes)

**With:** Yourself

During this time, carefully read the introduction, actively seeking answers to the questions you formulated earlier.
As you read, highlight or annotate key information to aid in your understanding and later review.

!!! tip
    Look for signpost phrases that indicate important information, such as:

    -   "The aim of this study is..."
    -   "We hypothesize that..."
    -   "To address this problem, we..."

#### d. Recite (10 minutes)

**With:** Your group

After reading, recite the main points of the introduction in your own words.
This step reinforces your understanding and helps identify any areas that may require further clarification.

!!! tip
    Try explaining the introduction to a classmate. Teaching others is an excellent way to solidify your understanding.

#### e. Review (5 minutes)

**With:** Your group

Review and reflect on how the information in the introduction relates to the overall study.
Consider how it sets up the rest of the paper and what predictions you can make about the methods or results based on this introduction.

!!! tip
    Consider creating a concept map or flowchart to visualize how the ideas in the introduction connect to each other and to the broader study.

### 2. Class Discussion and Synthesis (10 minutes)

**With:** Everyone

Be prepared to share your experience applying the SQ3R method.
Discuss the key components you identified in the introduction.
Compare the questions you formulated and answers you found with your classmates.
