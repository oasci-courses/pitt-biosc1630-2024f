Data interpretation
</h1>

Figures and tables are a crucial component of scientific papers, often conveying complex information in a visual format.
This guide will help you develop the skills to effectively analyze and interpret figures in computational biology papers.

!!! tip
    1. Start with the big picture: What's the overall trend or pattern?
    2. Pay attention to labels and units: Understanding what's being measured is crucial.
    3. Look for comparisons: How do different groups or conditions differ?
    4. Consider error bars: They provide important information about data variability.
    5. Think critically: Just because it's published doesn't mean it's perfect. What would you do differently?
    6. Connect to the text: How does the information in the figure relate to what's described in the results and discussion?

## Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

1.  Critically analyze scientific figures
2.  Extract key information from complex visualizations
3.  Relate figure content to the overall study objectives
4.  Identify potential limitations and improvements in data presentation

## Instructions

For each figure under "Results and discussion", we will do the following.

### Small Group Analysis

**With:** Your group

-   **Initial Observation:**
    Look at the figure carefully.
    Read the figure caption thoroughly.
    Identify the type of figure (e.g., graph, chart, diagram, image).
-   **Detailed Analysis:**
    Answer the following questions:
    -   What is the main message of this figure?
    -   What do the axes represent? (If applicable)
    -   What do different colors, shapes, or symbols represent?
    -   Are there any trends, patterns, or outliers you can identify?
    -   How does this figure support the study's motivation?
-   **Group Discussion:**
    -   Share your individual interpretations with your group.
    -   Discuss any differences in your interpretations.
    -   Try to reach a consensus on the figure's main message and how it relates to the study.

### Figure Analysis Guide

**With:** Your group

For each figure, work through the following steps:

1.  Describe what you see (**Observation**):
    -   List all the elements present in the figure (e.g., bars, lines, points, labels).
    -   Note any visual hierarchies or groupings.
    -   Identify the scale and units used.
2.  Explain what it means (**Interpretation**):
    -   Translate the visual elements into scientific concepts.
    -   Describe the relationships between different elements.
    -   Identify the main trend or result being shown.
3.  Relate it to the study's objectives (**Relevance**):
    -   How does this figure address the research question?
    -   What specific hypothesis or prediction does it support or refute?
    -   How does it fit into the larger narrative of the paper?
4.  Identify any limitations or potential improvements (**Critical Thinking**):
    -   Are there any aspects of the data that are not represented?
    -   Is the chosen visualization the most effective for this data?
    -   How could the figure be improved for clarity or impact?
    -   Are there any potential sources of bias or misinterpretation?

### Class Discussion

**With:** Everyone

Be prepared to share your group's insights with the class.

<!--
### 2. Link Methods to Results (20 minutes)

a) Review the results section of the paper.
b) For each step in your flowchart, identify the corresponding results.
c) Add these results to your flowchart, linking them to the appropriate methodological steps.
