<b>Activity</b><br>
Active reading
</h1>

**Total duration:** 50 minutes

## Objective

The objective is to engage students in active reading techniques to promote deep comprehension and critical analysis of scientific articles.

## Form groups

**Duration:** 0 minutes

Groups should already be formed from [this activity](activity:read-for-gist:form-group).

## Article selection

**Duration:** 0 minutes

Students should have selected an article from [this activity](activity:read-for-gist:article-selection) earlier.

## Active reading

**Duration:** 30 minutes

Now, start reading the scientific article using these active reading techniques.
While reading, note crucial information you need to answer the [following discussion questions](activity:active-reading:discussion-questions).

### Summarizing

As you engage with the scientific paper, make it a habit to **periodically pause and summarize what you've read in your own words**.
This summarization process is a crucial checkpoint, ensuring you can clearly articulate the paper's main ideas.
Consider the broader context of the research and distill the key points into concise summaries.
This practice solidifies your understanding and enables you to communicate the paperâ€™s main concepts.

### Annotating

Understand that annotating the text is a powerful tool for enhancing your active reading experience.
While reading, feel free to **underline or highlight key passages** that strike you as particularly important or insightful.
Additionally, **write marginal notes or comments** that capture your thoughts, questions, or interpretations.
You can even employ symbols or codes to mark critical information.
Annotation transforms your reading into an interactive process, making it easier to revisit and review essential points later.
It also serves as a personal dialogue with the text, enabling you to engage more deeply with the material and uncover nuanced insights.

## Discussion questions

- **Research objectives:**
  What are the main research objectives or questions addressed in the paper?
  Are they clearly stated and well-defined?
- **Methodology:**
  Can you describe the methods and techniques used in the study?
  Are they appropriate for the research questions, and are there any potential limitations or alternative approaches?
- **Key findings:**
  What are the primary findings or results presented in the paper?
  Do these findings align with the research objectives, and does robust evidence support them?
- **Data analysis:**
  How was the data analyzed, and were the statistical or computational methods appropriate for the study?
  Are there any potential biases or sources of error?
- **Interpretation:**
  How do the authors interpret the results?
  Do they clearly explain the implications of their findings within the broader context of computational biology?
- **Comparisons:**
  Does the paper make comparisons with existing research or related studies?
  Does it contribute novel insights or build upon existing knowledge?
- **Future directions:**
  Are there suggestions for future research or areas where further investigation is needed based on the paper's conclusions?
- **Open science practices:**
  Does the paper adhere to open science practices like sharing data, code, or materials?
  How might open science principles improve transparency and reproducibility?
- **Innovation:**
  Does the paper introduce innovative approaches, tools, or algorithms that advance computational biology research?

## Executive summary

**Duration:** 10 minutes

An executive summary is a concise, comprehensive document or section of a more extensive report, proposal, or paper.
It briefly overviews the document's main points, findings, recommendations, and critical elements.
It gives busy executives, decision-makers, or stakeholders a quick and accessible understanding of the content without reading the entire document.

Key characteristics of an executive summary include:

- **Brevity:** It is succinct and to the point, distilling the most critical information into a limited word count or page length.
- **Clarity:** It presents complex ideas and data clearly and easily understandable, using plain language and avoiding jargon.
- **Content highlights:** It highlights the full document's main objectives, findings, conclusions, and recommendations, offering a comprehensive overview.
- **Audience-centric:** It is tailored to the needs and interests of the target audience, often senior decision-makers or busy professionals who need a quick grasp of the document's essence.
- **No new information:** It does not introduce new information or concepts not already covered in the full document; rather, it summarizes existing content.
- **Format and structure:** It typically follows a structured format, with sections that mirror the organization of the entire document, such as an introduction, objectives, methods, results, conclusions, and recommendations.

With your group, **write a three-to-five-sentence executive summary** of your chosen paper.
Tailor the executive summary to judges for an "International Computational Biology Competition" about why your article deserves the award.
In this scenario, the executive summary is your group's chance to stand out among a sea of submissions and make a strong case for your research.
It's not just about summarizing; it's about presenting your findings strategically---without exaggeration---to engage and impress the judges, prompting them to delve deeper into this article.

## Panel selection

**Duration:** 10 minutes

Have groups with the same article anonymously submit executive summaries on [Top Hat](https://app.tophat.com).
Briefly review the summaries and provide some feedback.

Groups with different papers can vote with a multiple-choice question on which summary had the most efficient communication.
Or the instructor can choose unilaterally.

## ChatGPT submissions

As a side experiment, I am submitting these texts made entirely with ChatGPT-3.5 without editing.
I want to demonstrate the capabilities of generative AI.

I started the chat with the following primer.

> I am going to give you several messages of text from my paper. Please pay close attention.

After copying the main text (excluding figures, tables, and captions), I sent it the following message.

> Okay, you have seen all of the text from my scientific article.
>
> I would like you to draft a summary in at most five sentences.
> This draft, after edited by me, will be sent to judges for an International Computational Biology competition.
> This summary needs to impress the judges so that I can win the award to continue my studies. This means so much to me.

The responses are shown below.

For [10.1007/s10822-023-00516-2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10822-023-00516-2):

> In this groundbreaking study, we investigated the membrane-disrupting potential of Pse-4, a member of the Pseudin peptide family, and unveiled its remarkable effectiveness in its hexameric form.
> Through a comprehensive analysis, we observed that hexameric Pse-4 induces a dynamic helix-coil transition during membrane simulation, leading to the formation of hydrogen bonds with the E. coli bacterial membrane.
> This interaction resulted in the creation of visible pores in the membrane, leading to deformation and increased permeability, allowing water molecules to penetrate the membrane shell.
> These findings shed light on the mechanism of action of hexameric Pse-4 and its potential as a therapeutic candidate for combating multi-drug resistant bacterial strains, offering exciting possibilities for future research and drug development in the field of computational biology.

For [10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00945](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.3c00945):

> In this groundbreaking study, a novel methodology for predicting cholestasis and other complex toxicological endpoints is presented.
> The approach integrates mechanistic insights and pharmacokinetic considerations, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of compound toxicity.
> Through the use of low-level models and quantitative in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE), the method demonstrates superior sensitivity and predictive quality compared to traditional direct QSAR modeling.
> Importantly, this approach proves its robustness even when predicting structurally diverse compounds, emphasizing its potential for early drug development and safety assessment.
> The study's innovative framework holds promise for advancing computational biology and supporting next-generation risk assessments.
