Skeptical results
</h1>

After [analyzing figures](./data.md), it's crucial to compare your interpretations with the authors' claims in the results section. This activity will help you develop critical thinking skills and understand how visual and textual information work together in scientific papers.

## Objectives

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

1. Compare your figure interpretations with the authors' claims in the results text
2. Identify any discrepancies between visual and textual information
3. Critically evaluate the presentation of results in scientific papers

## Instructions

### 1. Read the Results Section (20 minutes)

- Now, read the results section of the paper carefully
- As you read, take notes on:
  - The authors' main claims about each figure
  - Any statistical analyses or numerical results presented
  - How the authors relate the results to their research questions or hypotheses

### 2. Compare and Contrast (20 minutes)

For each figure, create a comparison table:

| Aspect | Your Interpretation | Authors' Claims | Notes on Differences/Similarities |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------|
| Main Message |               |                 |                                   |
| Key Trends |                 |                 |                                   |
| Relation to Objectives |     |                 |                                   |
| Statistical Support |        |                 |                                   |

- Fill in your interpretations from step 1
- Add the authors' claims from the results text
- In the last column, note any differences or similarities between your interpretation and the authors' claims

### 3. Small Group Discussion (15 minutes)

Form groups of 3-4 students. In your group:

- Share your comparison tables
- Discuss any significant differences between your interpretations and the authors' claims
- Consider possible reasons for these differences:
  - Did you miss any important details in the figures?
  - Did the authors provide additional context in the text that wasn't clear from the figures alone?
  - Are there any claims in the text that don't seem fully supported by the figures?

### 4. Class Discussion (20 minutes)

Be prepared to share your group's insights with the class. Consider:

- What were the most common differences between student interpretations and authors' claims?
- Were there any figures that were particularly challenging to interpret without the text?
- Did the results text clarify any confusing aspects of the figures?
- Were there any cases where you feel the authors' claims weren't fully supported by the figures?

### 6. Reflection (10 minutes)

Individually, reflect on the following questions:

1. How did your interpretation of the figures change after reading the results text?
2. What have you learned about the relationship between figures and text in scientific papers?
3. How might this experience influence how you read scientific papers in the future?
4. If you were writing a paper, how would you ensure your figures and text work together effectively?

## Tips for Effective Comparison

1. Be objective: Try to set aside your initial interpretations and read the results text with an open mind.
2. Look for nuances: Sometimes the differences between your interpretation and the authors' claims may be subtle.
3. Consider the broader context: The results text may provide important information about experimental conditions or analyses that aren't evident in the figures alone.
4. Be critical but fair: It's okay to question the authors' interpretations, but also consider whether they have access to information or analyses that aren't fully represented in the figures.
5. Think about communication: Reflect on how effectively the authors have presented their results through both figures and text.
