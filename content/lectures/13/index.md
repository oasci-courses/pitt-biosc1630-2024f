This workshop is designed to help you get targeted feedback on your perspective paper and create a concrete plan for final revisions. If you are not planning to submit a final draft, you may work quietly on other coursework.

## Peer Review Session

Each paper will be reviewed using the following process:

1.  **Silent Reading**
    -   Reviewers read the paper
    -   Use provided feedback form to track observations
    -   Mark specific passages that need attention
2.  **Written Feedback**
    Complete the structured feedback form.

    **Argument Clarity** Is the main perspective clearly stated? Where?
    Are the arguments well-developed and supported?
    Note any points that need clarification

    **Evidence Support** Are claims backed by appropriate citations?
    Is evidence used effectively?
    Identify any assertions needing support

    **Logical Flow**
    Does the paper progress logically?
    Are transitions effective?
    Mark any disconnected sections

    **Technical Elements**
    Are technical terms properly explained?
    Are figures/tables effectively used?
    Note any formatting issues

    **Writing Style**
    Is the tone appropriately academic?
    Are sentences clear and varied?
    Mark any awkward phrasings

3.  **Verbal Discussion**
    Each reviewer shares:
    One major strength
    Two specific suggestions for improvement
    One question for the author

### Feedback Exchange Guidelines

## Revision Planning

### Organizing Feedback

Create a revision matrix:

| Section | Feedback Received | Action Items | Priority | Resources Needed |
|---------|------------------|--------------|----------|------------------|
| Intro | | | | |
| Field Overview | | | | |
| Analysis | | | | |
| Future Directions | | | | |
| Conclusion | | | | |

### Individual Planning

1. **Categorize Feedback**
    - Must address (affects core argument)
    - Should address (improves clarity/flow)
    - Could address (minor improvements)
2. **Create Timeline**
    - List specific revision tasks
    - Estimate time needed for each
    - Set internal deadlines
    - Plan review/editing time
3. **Identify Resources**
    - Additional sources needed
    - Writing center appointments
    - Office hours visits
    - Style guides
