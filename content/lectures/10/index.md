### **Day 2: Key Prediction Modules and Confidence Evaluation**

1. **Sequence-Local Atom Attention in AF3 (Group 1)**
   - **Focus**: Explain the sequence-local atom attention mechanism that AF3 uses to predict atom-level interactions within proteins【10†source】.
   - **Balanced Methodology Challenge**: Detail how atom attention differs from other types of attention mechanisms and why this is key for accurate predictions.
   - **Critical Thinking**: Why is atom attention necessary for predicting specific interactions, and what might happen if this mechanism was flawed?

2. **Triangle Updates of Pair Representation (Group 2)**
   - **Focus**: Describe how AF3 uses triangle updates to refine the pairwise representation of atom distances and interactions【11†source】.
   - **Balanced Methodology Challenge**: Focus on why triangle updates are essential for capturing the geometric relationships between protein atoms.
   - **Critical Thinking**: How do triangle updates improve the prediction of complex structures compared to linear updates?

3. **Predicted Local Distance Difference Test (pLDDT) and Confidence Metrics (Group 3)**
   - **Focus**: Explain how AF3 evaluates the confidence of its predictions using pLDDT and other confidence metrics【11†source】【12†source】.
   - **Balanced Methodology Challenge**: Dive into how these metrics assess the reliability of structural predictions and their importance for scientific use.
   - **Critical Thinking**: How do scientists interpret low-confidence predictions, and when should such predictions be disregarded?

4. **Diffusion Module and Multiscale Process in AF3 (Group 4)**
   - **Focus**: Discuss how the multiscale diffusion process refines local and global protein structures simultaneously【11†source】.
   - **Balanced Methodology Challenge**: Explain how different scales of diffusion are used to correct local structural errors while refining the overall protein shape.
   - **Critical Thinking**: What challenges might arise from applying a multiscale approach, and how does AF3 handle these challenges? -->
